# kusa-types
Access @ kusatypes.com

Reason for Project:
- Monkeytype Clone
- Just wanted to learn authentication and MERN stack. Really simple web application but also functions pretty well. Learned a lot from desiging this web

KNOWN-BUGS: 
- Automatic words displayed for the typing screen does not change unless youselect a new setting

 THINGS TO CHANGE:
- Change up the authentication. Make it more dynamic and just in general better
- Make the leaderboard better (kinda botched but it works as intended)
- Make the css better. Currentyl authenaticon pages are not always aligned
- Game results screen. Make it look better and add graphs
- Implement tailwindcss (maybe) one day

Pull the repo, run npm build on both frontend and backend change up the allowedOrigins through backend/config and change up axios.js through frontend/api to your personal needs, and it should workk as intended.
Create a .env file in backend with your base_url, database_uri, user_email, user_pw, access_token, and refresh_token.

Run both the frontend and backend on their ports and it should work. Run backend first and ensure its working.
